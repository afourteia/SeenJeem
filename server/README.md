# My Express App

This is a basic Express application written in TypeScript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. This project was built using Node.js version 14.15.1 and npm version 6.14.8.

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-express-app.git
```

Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies with:

```bash
cd my-express-app
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The application runs on port 3000 by default.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
my-express-app
├── src
│   ├── app.ts
│   ├── controllers
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── types
│       └── index.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md
```

- `src/app.ts`: This is the main application file. It sets up the Express application, imports and uses the routes from `src/routes/index.ts`, and exports the configured Express application.

- `src/controllers/index.ts`: This file exports one or more controller classes. Each controller class has methods that correspond to different routes in the application.

- `src/routes/index.ts`: This file imports the controllers from `src/controllers/index.ts` and sets up the routes of the Express application.

- `src/types/index.ts`: This file exports any custom TypeScript types used in the application.

- `package.json`: This is a standard file for Node.js projects. It specifies the project's dependencies and may also contain scripts for running, building, and testing the application.

- `tsconfig.json`: This is a configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies compiler options such as the target JavaScript version, module system, and strictness settings.

## Testing

To run tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```
